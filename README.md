💻 Power BI in Action: Data-Driven Decision Making

Data visualization is the future! I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze $1.20M in sales data and assess customer satisfaction across various outlets. 🔎📈

Here’s a sneak peek into the dashboard:
✔️ Sales Trends over the years, with insights into top-performing items and outlets
✔️ Outlet Size & Location Analysis
✔️ A visual breakdown of customer ratings and item-wise sales

By leveraging these insights, businesses can:
💡 Identify key growth areas
💡 Strategically optimize sales channels
💡 Improve customer satisfaction based on location performance

If you appreciate my work, please give it a star.⭐

For any issues, feel free to raise them.
